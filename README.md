# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description

This challenge required that we build a text editor that runs in the browser; the app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.  To build this text editor, we began with an existing application and implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. We also used a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API, which features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data.  The application was ultimately deployed to Render .
